I am currently based in the sunny  **Herzliya, Israel**,  and have inside information of some the best bakeries/coffee within a three kilomteres radius. Let me know if you're in the area, and [let's meet](https://calendly.com/itaybd)!  ☕

## `Views`
### Every day is a new test, where the most important tests in life happen unexpectedly. The challenges we are tackling (including our choice to do so) and the way we tackle them define us as human beings.
### 🗣 Communication is everything, especially in open-source.
Science and engineering are team sports.
### 🙋‍♀️ Relentlessly ask questions.
One of the most important figures in Judaism was an orchard guard with criminal past, that came to the classes (after doing his best to understand the material) and relentlessly asked questions trying his best to get to the truth. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_ben_Lakish

SCARECROW: 
	You promised us real things -- a real...brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	Why, anybody can have a brain.  That's a
	very mediocre commodity.  Every pusillanimous
	creature that crawls on the earth -- or
	slinks through slimy seas has a brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the
	Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be
	that as it may. Back where I come from we
	have universities, seats of great learning
	-- where men go to become great thinkers.
	And when they come out, they think deep
	thoughts -- and with no more brains than
	you have.... But!  They have one thing you
	haven't got!  A diploma!<br />
  Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.<br />
SCARECROW:
	Th.D.?<br />
WIZARD:
	Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!<br />
