## `Views`
### Every day is a new test, where the most important tests in life happen unexpectedly. The challenges we are tackling (including our choice to do so) and the way we tackle them define us as human beings.
### Titles: (Wizard of Oz Play/ Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allen Woolf) 
SCARECROW: 
	You promised us real things -- a real...brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	Why, anybody can have a brain.  That's a
	very mediocre commodity.  Every pusillanimous
	creature that crawls on the earth -- or
	slinks through slimy seas has a brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the
	Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be
	that as it may. Back where I come from we
	have universities, seats of great learning
	-- where men go to become great thinkers.
	And when they come out, they think deep
	thoughts -- and with no more brains than
	you have.... But!  They have one thing you
	haven't got!  A diploma!<br />
  Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.<br />
SCARECROW:
	Th.D.?<br />
WIZARD:
	Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!<br />
