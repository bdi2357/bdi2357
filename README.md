# üï∫üèº Hi, friend! Pleased to meet you.
Chances are, I've either directed you here, or you've been through my [website, open-source projects, and talks] in which case, welcome!  and [let me know if you have any questions](mailto:itaybd@gmail.com) Looking forward to working with you!
### üìû Contact

### üó∫ Location

I am currently based in the sunny  **Herzliya, Israel**,  and have inside information of some the best bakeries/coffee within a three kilomteres radius. Let me know if you're in the area, and [let's meet](https://calendly.com/itaybd)!  ‚òï

## `Views`
### Every day is a new test, where the most important tests in life happen unexpectedly. The challenges we are tackling (including our choice to do so) and the way we tackle them define us as human beings.
### Data-Centric approach
Without Data there are no models, the key for good models is good preprocessing.
### Opnions should be based on data and not the other way around.
### Samba Lando -> Qu√© tienes t√∫ que no tenga yo?
Zero tolerance to racism, discrimination of any kind. Preferences should have quantitative justification and in extreme cases qualitative with solid rigor behind. 
### üó£ Communication is everything, especially in open-source.
Science and engineering are team sports.
### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Relentlessly ask questions.
The most effective engineers (and leaders) are curious humans ‚Äî scientists, even if they don't know it ‚Äî and they're always, always asking questions, formulating hypotheses, running experiments.<br />
One of the most important figures in Judaism was an orchard guard with criminal past, that came to the classes (after doing his best to understand the material) and relentlessly asked questions trying to get to the bottom of the truth. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_ben_Lakish  
### üìÉ If you don't have documentation, you don't have a minimum viable product.
### üôè Believe in people, not in acronyms, Titles: Wizard of Oz Play Approach->
SCARECROW: 
	You promised us real things -- a real...brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	Why, anybody can have a brain.  That's a
	very mediocre commodity.  Every pusillanimous
	creature that crawls on the earth -- or
	slinks through slimy seas has a brain!<br />
WIZARD:
	Back where I come from we
	have universities, seats of great learning
	-- where men go to become great thinkers.
	And when they come out, they think deep
	thoughts -- and with no more brains than
	you have.... But!  They have one thing you
	haven't got!  A diploma!<br />
  Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.<br />
SCARECROW:
	Th.D.?<br />
WIZARD:
	Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!<br />
SCARECROW:
	The sum of the square roots of any two
	sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to
	the square root of the remaining side.  Oh
	joy, rapture!  I've got a brain!
	How can I ever thank you enough?<br />
WIZARD:
Well, you can't.
